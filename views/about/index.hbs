            Welcome to my e-Portfolio. My name is Ujjwal Gaba
            and I am a full-time student at the Georgian College
            majoring in Computer Programming. I chose to pursue
            Computer Programming because I like to explore more
            and do adventurous tasks.
            <br>
            What better than Computers to do so?
        </p>

            I value simple content structure, clean design patterns,
            and thoughtful interactions. I like to code things from
            scratch and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser.
            I genuinely care about people and love helping fellow
            designers work on their craft. Codding is an incredible
            form of expression, and I want to demonstrate its importance
            and effectiveness in my future. The development section is
            really important to me because I thereby constantly improve
            my skills and stay up-to-date with new methods and technology.
